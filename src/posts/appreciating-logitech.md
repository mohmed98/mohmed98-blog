## Why

A few years back, I bought the Logitech C270 HD 720p Webcam without much thinking as it was affordable and easy to get from a local e-commerce store. Last year, after a couple of bad experiences with mice, I went back to basics and bought the Logitech M90 Optical Wired Mouse because it was cheap and my Linux system was always testing me with Bluetooth. So far, this mouse has made me notice it was one of the best products I purchased in a very long time. Why?
- Cheap
- Does the job very well
- No fancy stuff
- Can deal with my hard treatment

So I bought two more Logitech products (headset and keyboard) and I wasn't disappointed, and that gave me the will to write this post.

## The headset

I had one good wired huge gaming headset and it was fine, but after a year the leather started to wear off and the wire isn't working so much anymore, so it was time for a new one. I went to one of the LLM chats and asked what is the equivalent for M90 mouse in headsets.

> Note: I even didn't notice I have the Logitech webcam as it did so much - hasn't it just been doing its job amazingly, right?

It came up with the Logitech H111 Stereo Headset. I looked it up on the internet to see the image - it was the most basic shape and made me worry, but I went to the store anyway. The person selling it to me made the concern that it didn't have noise cancellation, and the next Logitech product with noise cancelling was three times more expensive. I got it anyway and amazingly it's light on the head, small in the bag, and great quality. I was mad I didn't get it before - amazing!

## The Keyboard

I had a wired mechanical keyboard - it was my first mechanical keyboard and I didn't like it at all. The RGB colors and stuff isn't for me, lesson learned with its price. The idea of getting the equivalent for the M90 and H111 in keyboards popped in my head and surprisingly I got the suggestion for the Logitech Keyboard K120. The same moment with the first button press, how easily and good quality and so cheap it was feels illegal (social addiction trends effect). 

## The future

I will write in the LLMs what is the update for the M90 mouse and see what will happen.

Thanks Logitech
